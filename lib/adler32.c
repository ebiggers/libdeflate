/*
 * MAX_BYTES_PER_CHUNK is the most bytes that can be processed without the
 * possibility of s2 overflowing when it is represented as an unsigned 32-bit
 * integer.  This value was computed using the following Python script:
 *
 *	divisor = 65521
 *	count = 0
 *	s1 = divisor - 1
 *	s2 = divisor - 1
 *	while True:
 *		s1 += 0xFF
 *		s2 += s1
 *		if s2 > 0xFFFFFFFF:
 *			break
 *		count += 1
 *	print(count)
 *
 * Note that to get the correct worst-case value, we must assume that every byte
 * has value 0xFF and that s1 and s2 started with the highest possible values
 * modulo the divisor.
